# chd-app

This mini web app runs prediction on likeliness of a person with certain features (age, total cholesterol, bp, diabp, BMI and glucose level) are likely to have Cardiovascular Disease in the next ten years based on the Framingham CHD Dataset.

Credits to:	Chanin Nantasenamat, the dataprofessor youtuber from his penguin prediction streamlit app and the myfirstapp.py source code.

I code based on those two sources.

To make this app successful, I had spent days of learning, fumbling, frustation and of course procrastination. I am terribly sorry for taking very long time and didn't reach out whenever I need help.
